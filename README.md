# ‚öôÔ∏è GenEx ‚Äî AI-Powered Requirement Extraction Tool

> üöÄ Built during the **Barclays Hackathon ‚Äì Hack-O-Hire**

**GenEx** is a full-stack web application that automates the extraction and generation of software requirements from various document types such as **PDF, DOCX, Excel, audio, and video** files. It combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Whisper (for transcription)**, and custom rule-based logic to first **extract and categorize** functional and non-functional requirements, and then **assign MoSCoW priorities** to them.
